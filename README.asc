== PandaPost
These extensions allow you to represent Python NumPy/Pandas objects in Postgres.

WARNING: This is very much a work in progress. Expect the APIs and what is in each extension to change!

Currently you can think of PandaPost more as an experiment than anything else. It seems like it would be useful to be able to natively store ndarrays, DataFrames, etc in a Postgres column. Then again, maybe not. :)

If you can make use of any of this, please drop a line to our https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pandapost[Google Group]. We'd love any feedback!

== Example

NOTE: Eventually there will be an actual DataFrame Postgres data type

.Basic ndarray type storing a subclass (in this case, a Pandas DataFrame)
....
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS plpythonu;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS lambda;
CREATE EXTENSION PandaPost;
\set df pd.DataFrame.from_dict([{"a":1,"b":"a"},{"a":2,"b":"b"}])
SELECT repr(
    lambda(
      $l$(
        ndarray
      ) RETURNS ndarray
      LANGUAGE plpythonu
      TRANSFORM FOR TYPE ndarray
      AS $body$
        import pandas as pd

        return $l$ || :'df' || $l$
      $body$
      $l$
      , NULL::ndarray
    )
  );
  repr   
---------
    a  b+
 0  1  a+
 1  2  b
(1 row)
....
